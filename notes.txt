gunicorn is a WSGI server that more or less acts like the middle man between a web sever like nginx and the client
client -> request -> WSGI server -> Web Server -> Client
WSGI server spawns several workers that can handle several requests at a time.
WSGI server is fast, secure, has logging feature but can not serve static files like a development server
which is why nginx is needed.
