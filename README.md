# FileBucket
A website where uses can past text and files for other to copy over HTTP

File Bucket is an application I developed for my work to share text and files with
students I teach online. This app addresses issues with sharing media through other
services such as zoom or google docs. Often sharing text is limited by character
length, file storage is finite, and users must sign into their account. This app
avoids these inconveniences through a well-designed minimalistic and intuitive
approach.
