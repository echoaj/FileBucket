# FileBucket
A website where users can pass text and files for others to copy over HTTP.

File Bucket is an application I developed for my work to share text and files with
students I teach online. This app addresses issues with sharing media through other
services such as Zoom or Google Docs. Often sharing text is limited by character
length, file storage is finite, and users must sign in to their account. This app
avoids these inconveniences through a well-designed minimalistic and intuitive
approach.
